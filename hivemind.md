# Hivemind

## Session Summary (2026-02-28)
- User asked to create `hivemind.md` and store concise, token-efficient session memory.
- Preference: keep carry-forward notes short so future chats need less re-explanation.
- Workspace root: `C:\Users\prite\Documents\Core`.
- Android app path on home PC: `C:\Users\prite\Documents\CoreApp`.
- Current session actions: created this file; added Core app privacy policy files at `C:\Users\prite\Documents\CoreApp\play-store\privacy-policy.md` and `C:\Users\prite\Documents\CoreApp\play-store\privacy-policy-site\index.html`; rolled back in-app privacy policy link/activity changes; added website-native privacy page at `C:\Users\prite\Documents\Core\privacy-policy.html`, linked it from website `index.html`, and expanded wording for Play Store-friendly disclosures (permissions, third parties, data usage, retention, user controls).
- Active constraint: do not perform write operations under `C:\Users\prite\Documents\CoreApp\app` unless explicitly requested.
