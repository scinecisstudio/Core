        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 1, 2026</p>
        <p>This policy applies to Core Launcher for Android (<code>com.scinecis.launcher</code>) published by <strong>Scinecis</strong>.</p>

          <h3>1. Developer Identity and Scope</h3>
          <p>Developer/publisher entity: <strong>Scinecis</strong>. This policy covers user data accessed, collected, used, stored, and shared through Core Launcher on Android phones and tablets.</p>
          <p>This page is the official app privacy policy used for Google Play listing disclosure. In-app disclosures and permission prompts provide additional context when required by policy.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="feature-card">
          <h3>2. Data Categories We Process</h3>
          <p>Depending on enabled features and permission choices, Core may process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Installed app inventory/package names for launcher discovery, search, categorization, and app actions.</li>
            <li>Contacts data for contact search and favorite contacts in Quick Tiles (when granted).</li>
            <li>Calendar event metadata for today/upcoming events in Quick Tiles (when granted).</li>
            <li>Notification listener metadata used for icon badge counts (when enabled by user).</li>
            <li>Accessibility service event metadata for configured gesture/app-lock flows (when enabled by user).</li>
            <li>User-provided weather settings (for example city/location text and API key) for weather cards.</li>
            <li>Technical diagnostics/performance metadata generated by SDKs (for example crash traces and app performance signals).</li>
            <li>App interaction telemetry fields generated by in-app analytics logging (for example action names, screen names, and selected technical event parameters).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Core does not intentionally collect SMS content, call logs, microphone audio, camera media, payment card data, or government identifiers.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="feature-card">
          <h3>3. Why We Process Data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide launcher core functionality expected by users (app list, app search, categories, widgets, gestures).</li>
            <li>Run optional user-requested features (contacts, calendar, weather, notification badges, app lock).</li>
            <li>Maintain reliability and quality (crash diagnosis, performance monitoring, feature tuning).</li>
            <li>Apply remote configuration for compatible app behavior and controlled rollouts.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="feature-card">
          <h3>4. Data Stored on Device</h3>
          <p>Core stores launcher settings locally on device, including preferences and local database entries such as app organization states, shortcuts, selected contacts, and categories.</p>
          <p>Backup export/import is user-controlled. Exported files remain where you save them until you delete them.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="feature-card">
          <h3>5. Third-Party SDK and Service Transparency</h3>
          <p>Core may use the following third-party services. Data processed by these providers is limited to service operation and policy-compliant purposes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> product usage/engagement metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> crash diagnostics and stability signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Performance Monitoring:</strong> app performance and latency telemetry.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Remote Config:</strong> remotely delivered configuration values.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Installations / Sessions (transitive Firebase components):</strong> app instance/session support for Firebase services.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenWeather APIs:</strong> weather response data based on user weather setup.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some Google/Firebase dependencies may declare measurement-related permissions in merged app manifests (for example advertising identifier/attribution permissions) based on SDK behavior and Android version support.</p>
          <p>Third-party policy links:</p>
          <p>
            Firebase:
            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy</a><br />
            OpenWeather:
            <a href="https://openweathermap.org/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>
          </p>
          <p>We require third-party providers used by Core to handle data in line with Google Play policy requirements. We do not permit sale of personal and sensitive user data from Core through SDK integrations.</p>

        <article class="feature-card">
          <h3>6. Permissions and Feature Mapping</h3>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> weather data and service communication.</li>
            <li><strong>SDK-declared network/power/measurement permissions (for example ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, WAKE_LOCK, AD_ID, AdServices attribution permissions):</strong> SDK/runtime transport and measurement support.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If a permission is denied or revoked, related features may be unavailable.</p>
          <p>Core requests runtime permissions where applicable and should show in-app disclosure/consent where required by Google Play policy.</p>

          <h3>7. Data Sharing and Sale</h3>
          <p>We do not sell personal and sensitive user data.</p>
          <p>Data is shared only with service providers necessary to deliver app functionality (for example analytics/crash/performance configuration and weather response services), and only for disclosed purposes.</p>
          <p>Installed app inventory and other sensitive data are not shared for advertising or analytics monetization purposes.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="feature-card">
          <h3>8. Retention and Deletion</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Local data remains on your device until you remove it, clear app data, or uninstall Core.</li>
            <li>Exported backup files persist where saved until you delete them.</li>
            <li>Android backup/restore behavior can copy eligible app data according to OS backup settings and app backup configuration.</li>
            <li>Third-party provider retention is governed by their own policies and contractual controls.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Core currently does not require user account creation. If account features are introduced in the future, this policy and deletion flows will be updated to meet Google Play account deletion requirements.</p>

          <h3>9. Security</h3>
          <p>We apply reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect data. Data in transit should use modern encrypted transport (for example HTTPS/TLS) where applicable.</p>
          <p>No internet or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, but we continuously work to reduce risk.</p>

          <h3>10. International Processing</h3>
          <p>Service providers may process data in countries outside your own jurisdiction. Where required, we rely on contractual and legal safeguards provided by those processors and applicable law.</p>
